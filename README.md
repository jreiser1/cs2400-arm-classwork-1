# cs2400-arm-classwork-1

CS2400 ARM assembly programming classwork problems.

## C and assembly code

Follow the instructions for each of the following code samples in [Compliler Explorer](https://godbolt.org).

1. [printf](https://godbolt.org/z/y2YKew)
   1. What is the library function that is called?
   int printf()
   2. Research the implementation (source code) of this function.
   3. Find out if the program directly executes the output operation or it makes a *system call* to the operating system.
   The program makes a system call
   
2. [malloc](https://godbolt.org/z/kAZX7x)
   1. How are the arguments passed to `malloc` and `free`?
   Arguments are passed to malloc by value and to free by reference to the memory location of p
   2. Research the implementation (source code) of `malloc` and `free`.
   
3. [malloc array](https://godbolt.org/z/bBl0zx)
   1. How does this case differ from the previous one?
   It allocates a larger section of memory for the array and sets the CPU control bits once the execution is finished (mov vs. movs)
   2. [**hard**] Write your own tiny `malloc` by declaring a large `FILL` area and writing a `malloc` and a `free` subroutine.
   
4. [arrays](https://godbolt.org/z/lcH006)
   1. Port this code to VisUAL.
   2. Observe/show that this code writes the local array in reverse order to the `static` global array.
   r2 and r3 act as indexes for the dimensions of the array as it is iterated through, and r1 acts as a "temp" store location for the value of r3
   
5. [2d array](https://godbolt.org/z/Kr-Sn8)
   1. Port this code to VisUAL.
   2. How are nested `for` loops handled in assembly? Are they *"nested"* in assembly?
   They are not nested in the same sense that loops are nested in C, or another programming language. They are just incremented with two separate sequential indexes in two different registers to simulate the nesting behavior
   
6. [2d array with mul](https://godbolt.org/z/cHwSTR)
   1. Port this code to VisUAL. (It's the same as the previous but with multiplicatoin).
   2. Add your 32-bit unsigned integer multiplication algorithm as a subroutine and run the code. Verify its correctness.
